**Virtual memory** is a memory management technique used by modern operating systems to give applications the illusion that they have access to a large, 
continuous block of memory, even if the physical RAM is limited or fragmented. It achieves this 
by using both the computer's physical memory (RAM) and a portion of secondary storage (such as a hard drive or SSD) as an extension of RAM
