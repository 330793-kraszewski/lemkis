## Polynomial Namespace
The polynomial namespace contains templates and functions related to operations on polynomials.

## Polynomial structure template
A polynomial structure represents a polynomial with coefficients of type T.

## The components
coefficients: the vector of coefficients of the polynomial.
degree: the degree of the polynomial.

## Methods
operator+=: Adds two polynomials.
operator-: Returns the opposite polynomial.
operator-=: Subtracts one polynomial from another.
operator*=: Multiplies two polynomials.
operator/=: Divides one polynomial by another.
operator%=: Returns the remainder of dividing one polynomial by another.
operator(): Calculates the value of a polynomial for a given value value.

## Functions
operator+: Adds two polynomials.
operator-: Subtracts one polynomial from another.
operator*: Multiplies two polynomials.
operator/: Divides one polynomial by another.
operator%: Returns the remainder from dividing one polynomial by another.
divide: Divides one polynomial by another, returning a pair of quotient and remainder.
root_rational_candidates: Returns the candidates for the measurable roots of a polynomial.
gcd: Returns the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.

## Test function
The test function is used to test the operations of adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing and calculating the remainder of dividing two polynomials.
